            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>For many businesses, managing marketing, sales, and service SMS (Short Message Service) can be challenging due to the complexities of large-scale text messaging. Volt is a B2B SaaS startup that helps businesses manage their SMS infrastructure by providing a 'wrapper' around multiple SMS SaaS platforms, such as Twillio. They approached CodeLab, a student organization at UC Davis, to contract a team to build a FOSS (Free & Open-Source) mobile application demonstrating Volt's API. As a UI/UX Designer, I designed an intuitive mobile app that highlights the core features of Volt’s product, ensuring efficient communication for users & prospective customers.

                <p>Volt customers need a streamlined interface that improves efficiency and usability in managing SMS campaigns on the go. </p>

                <h2>Let's Chat with Stakeholders</h2>
                <p>So who was this demo app really made for? Potential Volt customers: business owners and developers who need to manage their company SMS campaigns efficiently. These users value simplicity, flexibility, and easy integration. </p>

                <h2>What Features First?</h2>
                <p>To begin our research, I suggested we utilize the <strong>MoSCoW method</strong> to sort the various features from Volt’s API into 4 categories for our project: Must Have, Should Have, Could Have, and Will Not Have.
                </p>
                <div class="intext-img">
                    <img src="images/vs/vs_mm.png">
                </div>
                <p>After considering factors such as user needs, time constraints, integration difficulty, and number of developers available, we decided to include <strong>(1) Contact Creation, (2) List Creation — groups of contacts, (3) 1:1 messaging, and (4) Pushes — one-time SMS blasts to a selected list,</strong> as we believed these features would be most beneficial for users.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="light">
                <h2>Ideation & Sketching</h2>
                <p>I crafted sketches for the <strong>messaging and "push" features</strong>, making sure to incorporate common design patterns for intuitive usability. I focused on how users recieve feedback during the communication process, asking myself <strong>why would users engage with these features?</strong> and <strong>what do they expect from messaging and notifications?</strong></p>
                
                <p>Once our client approved our concepts, we transitioned to prototyping on Figma.</p>

            <div class="dark">
                <h2>Testing 1..2..3...</h2>
                <p>I conducted task-based usability tests with <strong>7 users</strong> to gain comprehensive insights on how users create, view, and send messages and pushes.</p>

                <div id="challenges">
                    <div>
                        <strong><p>01 - Iconography</strong><br><strong>40% of users</strong> found our iconography challenging to understand, so we prioritized clarity by <strong>labeling icons</strong> in the navigation bar.</p>

                        </div>
                        <p>We also <strong>rebranded 'Waves' to 'Pushes'</strong> to better align with the feature's functionality. Our client endorsed this name change and implemented it across their platform.</p>

                    <div>
                        <strong><p>02 - User Feedback</strong><br>Within Volt's API, users have the capability to schedule messages, and to streamline the user experience, we <strong>aimed to reduce screen complexity.</strong></p>

                        <p>We introduced a <strong>message preview</strong> directly within the conversation thread, complemented by a timestamp indicating the scheduled delivery time.

                <p>Following our changes from usability testing, we were able to <strong>improve task completion rate by 42%</strong> and enhance user experience.

            <div class="light">
                <h2>Final Designs</h2>
                <p>We experimented with the <strong>Tamagui component library</strong> (to expedite the development proces), making modifications to optimize each flow and modernize features for a cleaner UI, all while maintaining consistency with Volt’s existing design system.

                <h2>Challenges</h2>

                <h4>TAMAGUI</h4>
                <p>Working with Tamagui presented challenges as it was our team's first experience integrating its components into our specific application. As a designer, it was a new challenge to integrate and adapt Tamagui's components to align with our app's distinct needs.</p>

                <h4>DESIGN TO DEVELOPMENT</h4>
                <p>As a student team balancing full academic course loads, we had to learn to balance our schedules to meet three times a week and collaborate asynchronously. Even though it took time to get used to checking Slack regularly, I embraced the opportunity to improve our handoff process and encouraged developers to message me for clarification on our wireframes to ensure the development of the best possible product.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="light">
                <h2>Results & Takeaways</h2>
                <p> While we await concrete metrics, we believe our emphasis on simplicity, efficiency, and user-centric design principleshas created a solid tool for Volt to showcase to clients. <strong>Volt acquired $3.0 million seed funding in June 2024, so I look forward to seeing where they go next!</strong></p>
                <br>
                <p>Looking ahead, there are several areas for potential improvement. For the next design team, we recommend implementing a <strong>more customizable UI</strong> based on ongoing user feedback to enhance usability. Additionally, we would have liked to explore <strong>integrating more advanced features from Volt's API</strong> that we didn't have time to include to further improve the user experience.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Personally, this project was a great experience. It was great to learn about the realm of SMS communications from a B2B and SaaS perspective and understanding the intricacies and priorities of a startup like Volt has been incredibly insightful.</p>
