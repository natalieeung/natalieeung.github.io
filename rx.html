            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>How can I break into the tech industry? This is a question that many, many, many people are asking themselves, but unfortunately, face a reality where it is all too difficult to find effective learning tools to enhance skills in their field and make meaningful connections. Radical AI is a startup aiming to change the landscape of online learning by harnessing the power of AI and gamified learning to guide users through interactive career-building activities. <b>As a UI/UX Design Intern, I worked on developing an Arcade Learning feature that combines coding courses with gamified elements to create a more engaging and personalized learning experience.</b>

                <p>For each identified use case, I started by mapping out a <strong>user flow</strong> and then <strong>drafted wireframes</strong> for each stage. AI-Tutors for coding was a vastly unexplored area at the time, so we got to be very creative with ideation, but eventually reeled in our featureset to ensure our project could be built given technical and time constraints.</p>

                <p>After finalizing our feature concept, I created high-fidelity mockups demonstrating specific capabilities of our Arcade Feature. RadicalAI had not established a solid branding system at this point, so I used this project as an opportunity to strengthen my skills in <strong>Visual Design</strong>! This project was my first experience <strong>incorporating AI generated content in my designs</strong>, particularly for avatars and color settings. I look forward to seeing what else can be done with these tools!</p>
