            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>
            <p>Commvault is the leading provider of data protection and management software applications related services. This past year, the UX team has taken the initiative to conduct assessments aimed at identifying areas where Commvault products need improvement to align with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), resulting in a list of 20+ areas requiring attention, each related to various web accessibility topics. Although developers were able to resolve most issues encountered, they lacked a centralized resource for addressing and preventing accessibility errors consistently.</p>

            <p>My project focused on designing an accessibility section within the internal design system site. This section includes detailed guidance on WCAG, potential compliance issues faced by Commvault engineers, and effective solutions. <b>As a UX Design Intern, I led research, design, and testing efforts for this initiative.</b></p>

                <div class="ps">
                    <p>CV developers lack one central location for guidance on Accessibility Practices and Principles, resulting in significant development time being spent on researching these issues.‚Äã</p>

                <br>
                <p><strong>‚Üí How do Commvault developers currently solve accessibility issues?</strong><br>We wanted needed to address and optimize critical steps in their workflow:</p>
                <div class="cv-3">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>üîé 01 Finding the Issue</strong><br>Developers refer to the most recent Accessibility Report to identify instances of poor accessibility</li>
                        <li><strong>üíª 02 Researching the Issue</strong><br>Developers use web to research WCAG guidelines to understand each error in full</li>
                        <li><strong>üìü 03 Fixing the Issue</strong><br>Developers devise code changes and implement these on company products</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p>We tried addressing one of these accessibility issues on our own and it took almost 3 hours to understand the issue itself! üòÖ</p>

            <div class="light">
                <h2>Analyzing Accessibility Resources</h2>
                <p>To begin, I did a comparative analysis to see what resources current  Web Accessibility guides and websites contain. I examined 7 different accessibility-related websites (Apple, Google M2 and M3, Salesforce, Univ. of Washington, Section 508, WebAIM) to better understand what exactly what types of content would help a developer in solving accessibility issues. </p>
                <div class="intext-img">
                    <img src="images/cv/cv_ca.png">
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>‚Üí We discovered that including visuals, simplified language, strong navigation would be most helpful for developers. Time permitting, wanted to also include interactive coding elements.</p>
                <br>
            </div>

            <div class="dark">
                <h2>Ideation to Wireframes...</h2>
                <p>Based on insights from our comparative analysis, we decided on features and content in our information architecture and devised a flowchart to outline the necessary decisions and  action to navigate the extensive guidelines. I am unable to show images, but here are some key takeaways:
                <div class="cv-3">
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>üìë Specific Guidelines</strong><br>The site will only contain guidelines that are applicable to Commvault rather than all 87 criteria (WCAG 2.2).<br><br>‚Üí Reducing the number of guidelines on the site would emphasize relevant issues and make navigation easier for users.</li>
                        <li><strong>‚úÖ Content </strong><br>Each guideline will contain a checklist, exceptions, example (if applicable), and ways to test for accessibility.<br><br>‚Üí These forms of content were most common on other accessibility related websites. We hoped to include editable code examples to increase comprehension of the issues.</li>
                        <li><strong>üó∫Ô∏è Navigation</strong><br>To navigate the site, users have the option of refering to the overview page, use the side-menu, or search function.<br><br>‚Üí Users of all levels of experience with accessibility will be able to find information on the site.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>I used FigJam to create sketches (and later, Figma to create wireframes) that supported each of these main screens, aiming to follow the established design patterns while incorporating new accessibility-related elements.</p>

                    <p>Every 2 weeks, I would have feedback sessions with my mentor and <strong>VP of UX Design, Parisa Bazl</a></strong> and share work with my fellow UX Development intern to ensure the project was feasible! I iterated through 3 rounds of wireframes before building them on Figma and on production.</p>

                <h2>Usability Testing</h2>
                <p>For usability testing, we reached out to <b>Commvault frontend developers</b> that may encounter accessibility issues in their work. We created a <b>two-part test</b> with a navigational portion as well as comprehension tasks with hypothetical scenarios to gauge ease-of-use as well as applicability.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>üó∫Ô∏è 01 Navigation</strong><br><br>We wanted to observe how users <strong>navigate the site</strong> and how they <strong>perceive the content</strong> on each page.<br><br>I wanted to focus on  how users used different information(guideline name, description details, key-words) to find guideline pages. Furthermore, we asked users to interact with content on all pages to gauge how intuitive the interactive elements were.</li>
                    <li><strong>üí≠ 02 Comprehension</strong><br><br>We wanted to see<strong> how developers would apply the principles</strong> and <strong>tools</strong> on our site to fix accessibility errors.<br><br>I provided testers with snippets of code from one of Commvault's products and highlighted accessibility issues. Testers were asked to identify the error, locate the corresponding guideline, and describe how they would address it.</li>

                <p>Using existing components and creating roughly 10 of my own, I created 3 main page templates for the Accessibility guide: an overview page, and a principle & guideline template. I am only able to show certain parts of the project per privacy agreements.

                    <p>We created an overview landing page that covered all the basic aspects of accessibility: definitions, principles, levels, and technologies. From here, users can navigate to specific principle pages to find more specific guidelines. We have also provided links to official resources for users to reference.</p>

                        <p>To help provide more guidance on certain WCAG issues and their criteria, we created editable live-updating code examples (if applicable), and tips for testing accessibility. These examples have similar components and structure to Commvault elements.</p>

                        <p>For some principles, we built in-site accessibility checker tools for users to interact with. For example, a color-contrast checker allows users to input colors, determine if the contrast ratio is high enough, and identify which WCAG levels it meets.</p>

                <p>I am incredibly grateful for Commvault for this internship opportunity and want to give a special thanks to my UX Development intern, Spencer Lyudovyk, and my manager Parisa Bazl. This project has greatly deepened my understanding of accessibility and completely reshaped how I incorporate it into my designs.
